<blockquote>Graded homework UI Design and HTML & CSS implementation combined

Task
Design & Implement
Your task is to design and implement three important views of an e-commerce shop. The views should be designed and implemented on the prototype level. 
The design target is desktop use so you should assume minimum 1024px display width.
In your design you should have the following views (THESE ARE FOR EXAMPLE, NOT FOR COPYING):
<li>Product listing (for example https://www.xxl.fi/vaatteet/miesten-vaatteet/miesten-takit/c/120404) - here you should list at least 10 different products</li>
<li>Product detail view (for example https://www.xxl.fi/helly-hansen-galway-parka-miesten-parkatakki-sininen/p/1162789_1_style)</li>
<li>Shopping cart (for example https://www.xxl.fi/cart). Your shopping cart must contain at least three products to showcase the UI design. </li>

Please use actual product information from actual manufacturers in your work. That way you do not have to spend time coming up with product descriptions, features etc.
